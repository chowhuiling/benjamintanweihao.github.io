###Fear Driven Learning

Recently, I brought up something that has been bothering me recently to a couple of my friends. I told them of a new term that I coined - __"Fear Driven Learning"__ - Using fear as the primary motivating factor to learn. While some might balk at associating learning with something so seemingly negative, hear me out first.

I am a Software Engineer. Or at least that is what I like to tell people I am. Deep down, I'm not so sure. I suspect this is the case with many of my friends who consider themselves as software engineers, whether defined by their ego, degree, or profession. I do not know half of what's covered in the _Design Pattern's_ book, nor I am familiar with most of what's in _Refactoring_. I don't test all of my code. I am not sure how long I can keep up with this pretense. So, I am afraid.

I am a Computer Science graduate. Or at least that is what my degree scroll says. Deep down, I'm not so sure. Sure, I consider myself a fairly good programmer. And I probably could still know my way around the Prolog compiler I wrote many moons ago. I still struggle with understanding concurrency, never implemented a bloom filter, and would probably struggle with any interview questions that would involve slightly more than trivial algorithms. So, again, I am afraid.

I have a great job that I look forward to everyday. I am privileged to be able to have the freedom to solve problems in anyway I deem fit. But I should not get too comfortable. Great things don't last, and no one is indispensable. That is something I am afraid of.

###Exploiting Fear

I want to let this feeling of _fear_ work to my advantage. This is where this blog comes in.

Here's the plan:

	1) Pick a book.
	2) Write a summary of the what I've learnt, whether by chapter/section.
	3) Do this twice/thrice per week.
	
So, what's in it for you, _Dear Reader_? Hopefully, I managed to scare you, at least a tiny bit. But I also hope that this somehow managed to kickstart your desire for self-improvement in your chosen craft. If that's the case, congratulations! and welcome aboard!. 

I aim to condense the absolute essentials of what I've read and learned (these two activities are mutually exclusive) into a single blog post, in the hope that I have filled my and your gaps. 

I have always tried to look for a site where the reader would post his/her learnings per chapter, instead of just reviews. But seems like I just have to implement that myself.

###In the Next Post ...

The first pick is [__Design Patterns in Ruby__](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321490452/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0321490452&linkCode=as2&tag=benjamintan-20). This book is much more readable that the original [GoF Design Patterns](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201633612/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0201633612&linkCode=as2&tag=benjamintan-20) book, as the book title suggests, its in _Ruby_ (GoF's examples are in C++). This book has been lying on my shelf for the longest time. It's time to put the book into good use.
